# Odd-Duck-Code201d93 LAB 11

Odd Duck Product Co is trying to decide which project from their R&D department they should invest in next to sell. They asked you to make a web page that they can run at a kiosk at the front entrance of their campus. Whenever an employee walks by, the employee can vote for 1 of the 3 products displayed that they think should be the next new product brought to market. After a week of collecting data, they would like some nice graphs to visualize the results.
